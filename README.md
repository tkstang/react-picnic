# react-picnic

React Picnic was a team project built by @tkstang and @ryanthissen.  This project was an introduction into building a front end application using React and Redux based off of the Cheeswhiz API http://cheeswhiz.herokuapp.com/api-docs/ built by two other G42 students as their Q2 project.  The app allows users to log in and search cheeses in the database by either animal or cheese firmness.
